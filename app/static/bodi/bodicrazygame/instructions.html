        <div>Instructions
            <ul>
              <li>Use 'a' and 'd' to move.
              <li>Press the space bar to jump.
              <li>Move and click your mouse to shoot and aim.
              <li>Collect coins and metal when you kill robots.
              <li>GAME OVER: is when you turn invisible and your score stops going up.
              <li>Health can be re-gained, when you buy health hit 'q' up to five times to rebuild your health. 
              <li>When you get 50 coins press 2 to buy a laser and press 3 to arm the laser.
              <li>When you have 15 metal press 'n' to deploy a nuke. Be prepared for the insanity that follows. Some choose not to use the nuke.
              <li>You can exchange metal for coins by pressing 4 and coins for metal by pressing 5, but you lose each trade. 
              <li>SHOPPING 
                  <ul>
                   <li>When you come upon the shop, click on one of the icons you select to buy (There is a bug, don't click the other shop)

                  <ul>
                   <li>To speed up the game, stay near the beginning moving back and forth to have the robots come to you.
                   <li>If you see no robots for a long time, you can start to travel.
                   <li>If you want to shop, you must travel until you find a shop.
